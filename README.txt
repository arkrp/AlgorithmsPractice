Greetings!

This is Hannah Nelson. The repository to which this message is attached is a storage for practice implementation of common algorithms. Each algorithm folder has a python implementation and a brief explanation of how the algorithm achieves its goal. Thats all there it to it!

This repository relies on Numpy

Currently implemented algorithms:
FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
QuickSort 
HeapSort
InsertionSort
Data Structures:
    Heap (lacks documentation)

Incomplete algorithms:

Planned algorithms:
A-Star
Simplex method
Quick Sort
Quick Select
Merge Sort
Hyper Log Log
A-B Tree (data structure)
K-D Tree (data structure)
Fibbonochi Heap (data structure)
Hash Set (data structure)
Hash Collection (data structure)
AVL Tree (data structure)
Order Statistic Tree
Binary Feasibility Range Objective Tree (data structure) (possibly a special case of branch and bound?)
Longest Shared Subsequence (2 list) (optimized dynamic programming)
Longest Shared Subsequence (2 list) (Huntâ€“Szymanski Algorithm)

Testing:
To test any given module use the following command:
(cd ..;python3 -m AlgorithmsPractice.<subpackage name>.<submodule name>)
Example:
(cd ..;python3 -m AlgorithmsPractice.Sorts.module_heap_sort)
